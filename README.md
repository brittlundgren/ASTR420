# ASTR420
Computational astronomy explorations for upper-level undergraduates


These Jupyter notebooks are designed to be run from the SciServer Compute environment (http://www.sciserver.org/tools/compute/). SciServer provides a web-based platform for interacting with the vast database of astronomical imaging and spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000). All of the computing is done in the cloud, so there's no need to download anything to a local computer. The only thing required to get started exploring the universe is a web browser!

Instructions for setting up a free account on SciServer can be found in the included document.

If you set up a SciServer account and upload these notebooks into a new “container”, they should compile without error. There are two versions of each of the python notebooks in this repository. One has all of the output cleared, and one is fully compiled with worked solutions for each provided prompt.

These activities use the programming language Python 3 to interface with the SciServer, although they could be modified to use R.

    "In [Chapter 3 of \"The Realm of the Nebulae\"](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.210893/page/n75/mode/2up), Edwin Hubble discusses the large-scale distribution of \"nebulae\" on the sky.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a figure of Hubble's observations, which showed that at high galactic latitudes, the density of galaxies on the sky is appoximately constant, while numbers are suppressed at latitudes close to the Milky Way's disk, where their observation is obscured by high densities of stars and the interstellar medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"img/Realm_0079.jpg\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **galactic coordinate system** defines the Sun as the origin. Galactic longitude (l) is measured with primary direction from the Sun to the center of the galaxy in the galactic plane, while the galactic latitude (b) measures the angle of the object above the galactic plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"img/gallat.jpeg\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore the distribution of stars and galaxies in the SDSS dataset, and also map the levels of dust extinction affecting distant galaxies, as a function of galactic latitude.\n",
